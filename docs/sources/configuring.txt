Configuring CouchDB
===================

.. todo:: Configuring CouchDB

CouchDB Configuration Files
===========================

.. todo:: CouchDB Configuration Files

Configuration File Locations
============================

CouchDB reads files from the following locations, in the following
order.

1. ``PREFIX/default.ini``

2. ``PREFIX/default.d/*``

3. ``PREFIX/local.ini``

4. ``PREFIX/local.d/*``

Settings in successive documents override the settings in earlier
entries. For example, setting the ``bind_address`` parameter in
``local.ini`` would override any setting in ``default.ini``.

.. warning::
   The ``default.ini`` file may be overwritten during an upgrade or
   re-installation, so localised changes should be made to the
   ``local.ini`` file or files within the ``local.d`` directory.

.. _update-notifications:

Update Notifications
====================

.. todo:: Update Notifications


MochiWeb Server Options
=======================

Server options for the MochiWeb component of CouchDB can be added to the
configuration files. Settings should be added to the ``server_options``
option of the ``[httpd]`` section of ``local.ini``. For example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [httpd]
    server_options = [{backlog, 128}, {acceptor_pool_size, 16}]

Socket Options Configuration Setting
====================================

The socket options for the listening socket in CouchDB can now be set
within the CouchDB configuration file. The setting should be added to
the ``[httpd]`` section of the file using the option name
``socket_options``. The specification is as a list of tuples. For
example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [httpd]
    socket_options = [{recbuf, 262144}, {sndbuf, 262144}, {nodelay, true}]

The options supported are a subset of full options supported by the
TCP/IP stack. A list of the supported options are provided in the
`Erlang inet`_ documentation.

.. _Erlang inet: http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/inet.html#setopts-2

``vhosts`` definitions
======================

Similar to the rewrites section of a ``_design`` document, the
``vhosts`` system uses variables in the form of ``:varname`` or wildcards in
the form of asterisks. The variable results can be output into the
resulting path as they are in the rewriter.
